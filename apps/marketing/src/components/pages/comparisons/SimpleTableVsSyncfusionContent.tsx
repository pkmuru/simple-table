      Syncfusion has established itself as a comprehensive enterprise UI component suite, offering
      over 80 components including their DataGrid. With a commercial license requirement for most
      businesses—priced at $995/developer/year (though free for companies with less than $1M in
      annual revenue)—Syncfusion represents a significant investment in a full-featured ecosystem.
      However, many development teams find themselves using only a fraction of the component suite,
      primarily needing just the data grid functionality. This is where{" "}

      presents a compelling alternative for teams seeking powerful data grid capabilities without
      the overhead of an entire component library. At{" "}

      (minified + gzipped), Simple Table delivers exceptional performance with core data grid
      features that rival Syncfusion's capabilities—all while remaining completely free. This
      comparison examines whether you can achieve your data grid goals without the licensing costs,
      bundle overhead, and component library lock-in that Syncfusion demands. We'll break down the
      true cost of ownership and help you determine if Simple Table can deliver the
      enterprise-level functionality your application needs without the enterprise price tag.

        is a lightweight, free alternative to Syncfusion, offering essential features like
        virtualization, infinite scroll, row grouping, and advanced filtering, with a significantly
        smaller bundle size (

        an entire component suite or licensing fees.

        already invested in the Syncfusion platform.
