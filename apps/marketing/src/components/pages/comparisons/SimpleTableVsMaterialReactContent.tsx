      When building React applications that require both Material Design aesthetics and advanced
      data grid functionality, developers often evaluate{" "}
      <Text className="text-lg text-inherit" strong>
        Material React Table
      </Text>{" "}
      (MRT)—a popular library that combines TanStack Table's powerful features with Material-UI's
      polished components. While Material React Table offers an excellent solution for teams already
      invested in the Material-UI ecosystem, it comes with the overhead of requiring Material-UI as
      a dependency and a larger bundle size compared to standalone alternatives.{" "}
      <Text className="text-lg text-inherit" strong>
        Simple Table
      </Text>{" "}
      offers a compelling alternative for teams seeking advanced data grid features without the
      Material-UI dependency. At just {SIMPLE_TABLE_INFO.bundleSizeMinGzip} compared to Material
      React Table's {MATERIAL_REACT_TABLE_INFO.bundleSizeMinGzip}, Simple Table delivers comparable
      functionality with a significantly lighter footprint. While it doesn't come with Material
      Design styling out of the box, its flexible theming system makes it possible to achieve
      Material Design aesthetics if desired. This comparison examines the trade-offs between
      Material React Table's pre-built MUI integration and Simple Table's lightweight,
      framework-agnostic approach to help you determine which solution best fits your project's
      needs.

        is a lightweight data grid with official adapters for {SIMPLE_TABLE_FRAMEWORKS_SHORT},
        sharing one core engine. It's ideal for projects that need a performant table component
